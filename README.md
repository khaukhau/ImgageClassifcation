## Project Description:
Adapted from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the objective of this programming project has involved the extraction of features from the image for observing the patterns in the dataset to classify one object in one image. Several contributed characteristics are initially established in the model: the input format is 3x32x32 (3 colors and 32x32 pixels); there are ten class categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck); the dataset used is CIFAR-10 that is labeled subsets of 60,000 images dataset (each class contains 6,000 images). Our team aims to reach over 80% of the expected accuracy for the image classification task.
